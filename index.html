                    <p class='first'>Nearly every webdev article seems to say that I should have some kind of blog charting 
                    my journey through learning webdev, so I finally gave in. Of course as a webdev student 
                    it wouldn't make any sense to blog on someone else's site, so I'm building my own. I don't 
                    know enough about webdev yet to build anything other than a static site, so the beginning of
                    this blog isn't going to look pretty. I am currently typing this blog post directly into the 
                    HTML file, and I doubt the blog is going to look pretty at the end of tonight. Let's see for
                    ourselves:</p>

                    <p>Not my best work! But I figured it was better to get into the practice of blogging frequently
                    over waiting to build a site to the standards I'd like to. It should also be interesting to see 
                    the evolution of the blog site itself over time!</p>
                    <p>A little background on me: I started webdev as a hobby early last year as a way to cope with 
                    unemployment using <a target='_blank' href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/'>Free Code Camp</a> and various other 
                    online resources. A combination of running into a wall learning-wise and re-employment caused me 
                    to stray from the path shortly after I started learning React-Redux. It never really left my head,
                    though, and in the fall of 2019 I applied to be in <a target='_blank' href='https://lambdaschool.com/'>Lambda School</a>
                    and was accepted into the Web 28 cohort, starting in January.</p>
                    <p>It's been a whirlwind of a time since then, spending at least 8 hours a day nearly every day either learning
                    or coding. I've just now officially finished the first unit, which means I officially owe them money, so I suppose
                    there's no dropping out at this point! In all seriousness, it's been a great learning experience so far and I'd 
                    definitely give my recommendation to them. It's not for the faint of heart; the learning pace is breakneck and 
                    the material covered is challenging. But the community is extremely supportive and if you ask for help and connect
                    with your peers, I have no doubt you too could make it in this program. I need to stop ranting and start building this 
                    blog site, so I'll leave it there for now. Here's hoping I make it past more than one post!</p>

                    <p class='first'>So I made it to the second post, more than I can say about any previous attempts at any kind of writing. Maybe
                    it's the fact that I'm building the blog as well as writing in it that's keeping me going. After today's lesson I'm
                    confident that very soon I'll know how to implement a better system than writing blogposts directly into HTML, so 
                    that's a plus.</p>
                    <button class='show'>Show more</button>
                    <p>Today was an interesting day, as it was the first day back on regular lessons after my first build week. What's build
                    week, you ask? It's a week I have to work with a team to make a working app, or at least that's what it's going to be
                    next time. This time I made a static marketing site for the app, which is a bit less exciting but much more within my
                    skillset. I think it turned out well, you can judge for yourself <a href='https://watermyplants3.github.io/marketing-ui/' target='_blank'>here</a>
                    (I made the homepage and about page, as well as the header and footer present on every page).</p>
                    <p>Anyway, the first day back was interesting. I watched the videos in the training kit and felt a bit out of my depth initially,
                    with all this talk about Document Object Model and assigning elements to variables. After the lesson I felt I had a 
                    more solid grasp on the task at hand, so I took a swing at the project. I was fairly easily able to perform the task
                    I had been assigned, but I wasn't satisfied with my code.</p>
                    <p>Since the first day here at Lambda School, they've been telling us to make sure to write code that Doesn't Repeat Yourself,
                    or DRY for short. Even someone who has never touched coding could see that the code I had written repeated myself quite a bit.</p>
                    <img src='assets/code-bad.png' alt='Some pretty bad but passing code' title='No bueno' />
                    <p>Even though my code made the webpage display correctly, it wasn't good code. You can see where, towards the middle,
                    I began to write it in a slightly different way so that it was a bit less tedious but it was still the same pattern of 
                    writing a line to assign an element to a variable, then writing some code to put text in that element. I still had a stretch
                    project left to complete, but I knew there had to be a better way. I did some research and read a bunch of documentation and spent
                    around another hour tinkering with the project and ended up with what I think is a much better result:</p>
                    <img src='assets/code-good.png' alt='My best effort at code that is not repetitive' title="I even remembered to comment!" />
                    <p>To someone who can't read code it's much harder to suss out what this code does, but at the very least you can see
                    that there's not much repitition to be found, and without the comments it's about half as many lines. I wasn't going to get a better grade because I wrote my code better, but I 
                    finally felt at peace enough to move on to the stretch project of building a <a target = '_blank' href='http://jacobengland.computer/DOM-I/stretch-assignment/digital_timer/'>timer</a>.
                    All in all, I feel like I had a productive day, and I'm sure the drive to keep doing more than I'm asked to or will even
                    necessarily be rewarded for is going to benefit me as far as my learning experience goes.</p>

                <time>02/11/2019</time>
                <section class='post-content'>
                    <p class='first'>Probably gonna be a short post today, it was kind of a slow and unproblematic day. Today was the second half of the beginning of lessons
                    really starting to get into what modern internet development is about. Yesterday was about dynamically inserting content and styling onto a 
                    page, and today was all about writing code to handle "events," such as a click, a scroll, or a key press. The styling language CSS has been 
                    updated since its beginnings to be able to handle some more basic events like clicking a button or detecting if the mouse is hover over an 
                    element on the page, but they aren't really useful for anything other than changing how something looks or where it is on the page</p>
                    <button class='show'>Show more</button>
                    <p>Most of the code used to handle these events follows the same basic structure. First we store an element on the page, like say the date 
                    at the top of this post. If you go inside of the code, it would be enclosed in a time tag, so we would tell Javascript to look for elements
                    inside of time tags and put them in a list. Then we would write code that would say to look at everything in that list and assign it what is 
                    called an "event listener," which is really just what it sounds like: a function that is waiting for an event to happen. You have to tell it
                    which event it is listening for, so in this case maybe a click. All that's left to do is to tell it what to do when it registers a click,
                    something like turning the text red. And that's it! The code we write might end up looking something like this:</p>
                    <img src='assets/event-listener.png' alt='Example code for an event listener function' title='No comments today! For shame!' />
                    <p>And you're done! It might still look a little complicated but it's really just those three steps: make a variable point at a page element, 
                    tack a function on to tell it which event to wait for, and tell it what to do when that event happens. If you can remember those three steps
                    you're well on your way to your first baby steps in making web pages that react to your user's input! If you're where I was earlier today though,
                    now you have to think of ten different things to make a webpage do, and that's a different beast entirely. . .</p>

                <h2>Blog Expansion</h2>
                <time>02/12/2020</time>
                <section class='post-content'>
                    <p class='first'>If you scroll through the blog today you may notice a few new things! Most notably, all the blog posts can now
                    be expanded to show more content or, conversely, contracted to hide all but the first paragraph. This allows me to fit more content within
                    the window view, which I guess isn't a problem at this point but we're planning on it being one! I also made it so that the latest post is 
                    expanded but all the older ones aren't, which may sound like something that happens automatically, but it was actually a pain!</p>
                    <button class='show'>Show more</button>
                    <p>The exanding and contracting actually has more to do with yesterday's curriculum than today's, despite what you might think. It's mostly 
                    a simple trick: I added a button and when you click it, it hides itself and makes the rest of the content appear, along with a closing button 
                    at the bottom. When you click the bottom button? It hides the content and itself and makes the top button appear! You could do it all day if 
                    you wanted to, but it'd make it pretty hard to read this blog post.</p>
                    <p>As far as deciding whether a post is open or closed when you first load the page, it's almost as simple. I just have Javascript make a list
                    of all the posts, and hide the lower content on all but the last one. The last one? Surely I mean the first one! Well if you look at the HTML for
                    the page you would see that in there all the posts are in top-to-bottom chronological order, whereas the posts are displayed in the opposite of
                    that order. So the most recent post is the last post in the list, which might fool someone who isn't familiar with the rest of the site's code, or me
                    earlier today when I was trying to hide all but the first post on the page.</p>
                    <p>All that was left to do at that point was add some fancy button styles- or so I thought. At the last second before I was going to upload the
                    finished site, I noticed an annoying bug. When you clicked the expand button, about 90% of the time the page would scroll you to the bottom of 
                    the post and you'd have to scroll back up to where you left off.</p>
                    <img src='assets/bad-expand.gif' alt='An animated gif showing the expansion bug' title='Wow, he has GIFs now? The money really changed him' />
                    <p>Not a life-ending bug, but certainly an annoying one, and I can't afford to lose any of my readers with the holidays fast approaching. So I spent
                    another hour researching and experimenting. None of the solutions on long-abandoned help threads seemed to help, and a lot of the solutions I came up with
                    would have worked in a different situation but not this one. Finally, after the fifth or sixth page on scroll properties, inspiration struck: 
                    scroll is saved as a number representing how far from the top you've scrolled, so if I saved that value before adding the content, I could manually
                    set the user's scroll to be the same once I added the content. It seemed like a far-fetched solution to me when I spun it up, but once I implemented 
                    it I could see that it worked like a dream! Crisis averted.</p>
                    <p>As far as today's curriculum, it was about using Javascript to take raw text data and make it into page elements like titles and paragraphs. This is 
                    something I've desperately wanted to do to this blog. However, next week we're going to be learning a much more advanced method for doing this that will 
                    make it even easier than it would be if I used what I learned today to do it, so I'm going to hold off and keep hard-coding all the blog posts into the 
                    HTML. Instead, I kept in mind that I was going to refactor soon and built my button component in a more future-proof way than I might have normally. Hopefully
                    I guessed correctly and won't have to redo everything I did today next week, but if I do that's just more practice! Stay posted and we'll both find out.</p>

                <h2>Fun With APIs</h2>
                <time>02/13/2020</time>
                <section class='post-content'>
                    <p class='first'>Today started out feeling like an intimidating day, but as it went on it became a lot more easy and I even acquired some fun skills that will
                    let me build more fun things than I even imagined I could have yesterday! In fact the first one of those things is in this very post! At the beginning of the day 
                    they told us we were going to be learning about "promises" which, frankly, sounds like some kind of cult to me. It turns out it's just a fancy name for telling your 
                    code to do something while it's waiting on something to load! Not actually very scary at all.</p>
                    <button class='show'>Show more</button>
                    <p>The rest of what we learned about was how to use APIs, which is not something I was expecting to get to so early. Basically an API is code someone else wrote that 
                    allows you to access a database on their end. The example they made us build was kind of boring, just taking our Github profile and displaying information from it in 
                    a list. But since I was brimming with newfound knowledge and had a bit of time to kill I decided to build my own component using what I learned. I looked around for an
                    API to build on and found that NASA has a public API that allows me to get some pretty cool stuff. So I started reading the documentation and ended up building an element
                    that displays a different photo from NASA every day:</p>
                    <div class='nasa'></div>
                    <p>It might not look like much right now but I promise if you come back tomorrow, it'll be a different picture. I initially intended to make it so you could browse through
                    several different photos but it ended up being much more difficult than I anticipated and I'm short on time today, so maybe some other time. But as it is, it makes a request 
                    from NASA for the photo, description, and link to a higher res version, and then automatically builds a component out of them and puts it into the page. I'm pretty excited to 
                    see what other APIs I can find and what I can build with them, because this definitely seems like it's just the beginning!</p>

                <section class='post-content'>
                    <p class='first'>This week's posts might be a little light on content because it's finally React week! Some of you might be wondering what that means, but don't worry, we'll get
                    to that in the rest of the post. Bascially what it means for the blog is I'll finally be refactoring it to work more like a regular website, with a text box I type into to enter 
                    my posts into the website instead of me writing my posts directly into the code. In fact, the HTML file for the website will be looking much more bare than it does right now. Exciting 
                    stuff that we'll be getting into in the upcoming days!</p>
                    <button class='show'>Show more</button>
                    <p>But I'm getting ahead of myself, I need to catch everyone up on what exactly React is. React is one of many libraries available to developers, a library being a set of code another developer 
                    wrote to make their lives easier that I now get to use to make mine easier. In this case the developers who wrote the code are the developers of Facebook, and the part of my life that's going to
                    be easier is building the user interface - the face of my website. This all gets quite high level, so I most likely won't cover all the specifics but from what I've done in React so far, they've 
                    made the coding much more easy and the code much more readable.</p>
                    <p>Take, for example, this very blog post. As it is the codefor just this post is very verbose. If you scroll through my HTML it's a massive block of text, which can make it quite difficult to work
                    with. Here's as much of it as I can fit into a screenshot:</p>
                    <img src='assets/this-very-post.png' alt='The code for this post' title='No reading ahead for spoilers!' />
                    <p>And that's about as concise as it gets using this method. What would it look like if I used the methods from last week? Glad you asked! Here's basically what it would look like:</p>
                    <img src='assets/this-post-component.png' alt='An example of how this code would look if it was made using a component' title='Quite the trim!' />
                    <p>Where did all the content go? Well the code for making the shape of the content would be inside the Javascript file, and would be reminiscent of the repetitive mess from <a href='jacobengland.computer/blog/index#back-for-seconds'>
                    my second post</a>. The content itself would likely be stored in a separate file that I would have the Javascript read and sort into the structure. That all seems like a very good improvement over how 
                    it started off, but with React we can do even better. Not only this post, but the entire blog would look like this if I was using React:</p>

                    <p>Wow! The whole blog would be inserted inside that single div element between the body tags! Why doesn't everyone just use React? Well honestly, for something like this blog React is almost definitely overkill. The React 
                    library is not a small file, so it comes with some less than optimal load times. One of the main reasons to use React is that it updates components as the information inside the components update, and on
                    a blog like this the updates (generously) come once a day, so that kind of rendering isn't super beneficial. But this blog is just as much about me getting some practical practice in with the skills I'm 
                    learning as it is about me letting you all know what I'm up to, so I'll be refactoring the whole blog to use this system. This will also make the whole thing easier to work with and I'll be able to add some
                    features that have been sitting in the backlog, like tags on the blogposts you can sort posts by. I doubt it will be the last time I refactor the whole thing, so don't get too comfortable!

                <h2>Revisiting NASA</h2>
                <time>02/19/2020</time>
                <section class='post-content'>
                    <p class='first'>Today I opened the training kit to find out the project was identical to something I did independently just a few days ago: making a component that would show the NASA photo of the day. Even
                    though I only did it a few days ago, my skillset has already grown to the point that features I couldn't figure out how to add then were now within my reach. Specifically, I initially set out with the intention
                    of allowing the user to scroll to previous days' photos.</p>
                    <button class='show'>Show more</button>
                    <p>Not only was I able to add that, but I also ended up adding a little calendar selector that let you pick any day you desired. You can see the final product <a href='https://jacobengland.computer/nasa-photo-of-the-day'>here</a>,
                    but this is a two day project so if you're looking at it between this blog post and the next one it's not pretty. The next post will be about styling so I'll make sure to include before and after pictures.</p>
                    <p>This project is the first project I've built from scratch in React, which presented some unique challenges. I had to decide how the elements would be broken down into components, which ended up feeling a little
                    inconsistent. For example I chose to make the photo and the buttons their own component, but the description and everything around it was included in one component. I'm thinking in the future for an app of this size
                    I'm going to build out the entire app in one big block and then decide what should be a component from there. I am happy with the approach of building out functionality before adding any styling, but it's probably only 
                    possible because the app is this small.</p>
                    <p>Overall, it's very interesting to see the very rapid progress I'm making within a vey short time period. Just a few days ago I couldn't figure out how to re-render the photo when the user changed the date, but now I'm 
                    really starting to feel the benefits of using React, as one of its core features is that it repaints the whole page every time an element changes. I also have a good idea now of how I would have done it last week using only
                    pure Javascript, so it seems like using React makes you stronger in Javascript as well, as opposed to something like a CSS preprocessor, which makes you get better at using the preprocessor instead of better at CSS. I'm looking
                    forward to seeing what I'll be able to do in another week!</p>
