                <h2>Hello World!</h2>

                <section class='post-content'>
                    <p>Nearly every webdev article seems to say that I should have some kind of blog charting 
                    my journey through learning webdev, so I finally gave in. Of course as a webdev student 
                    it wouldn't make any sense to blog on someone else's site, so I'm building my own. I don't 
                    know enough about webdev yet to build anything other than a static site, so the beginning of
                    this blog isn't going to look pretty. I am currently typing this blog post directly into the 
                    HTML file, and I doubt the blog is going to look pretty at the end of tonight. Let's see for
                    ourselves:</p>
                    <img src='assets/blog-02092020.png' alt='The blog as it appeared on the day of this post' title='The blog as it appeared on 02/09/2020'>
                    <p>Not my best work! But I figured it was better to get into the practice of blogging frequently
                    over waiting to build a site to the standards I'd like to. It should also be interesting to see 
                    the evolution of the blog site itself over time!</p>
                    <p>A little background on me: I started webdev as a hobby early last year as a way to cope with 
                    unemployment using <a target='_blank' href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/'>Free Code Camp</a> and various other 
                    online resources. A combination of running into a wall learning-wise and re-employment caused me 
                    to stray from the path shortly after I started learning React-Redux. It never really left my head,
                    though, and in the fall of 2019 I applied to be in <a target='_blank' href='https://lambdaschool.com/'>Lambda School</a>
                    and was accepted into the Web 28 cohort, starting in January.</p>
                    <p>It's been a whirlwind of a time since then, spending at least 8 hours a day nearly every day either learning
                    or coding. I've just now officially finished the first unit, which means I officially owe them money, so I suppose
                    there's no dropping out at this point! In all seriousness, it's been a great learning experience so far and I'd 
                    definitely give my recommendation to them. It's not for the faint of heart; the learning pace is breakneck and 
                    the material covered is challenging. But the community is extremely supportive and if you ask for help and connect
                    with your peers, I have no doubt you too could make it in this program. I need to stop ranting and start building this 
                    blog site, so I'll leave it there for now. Here's hoping I make it past more than one post!</p>

                <h2>Back for Seconds</h2>
                <time>02/10/2019</time>
                <section class='post-content'>
                    <p>So I made it to the second post, more than I can say about any previous attempts at any kind of writing. Maybe
                    it's the fact that I'm building the blog as well as writing in it that's keeping me going. After today's lesson I'm
                    confident that very soon I'll know how to implement a better system than writing blogposts directly into HTML, so 
                    that's a plus.</p>
                    <p>Today was an interesting day, as it was the first day back on regular lessons after my first build week. What's build
                    week, you ask? It's a week I have to work with a team to make a working app, or at least that's what it's going to be
                    next time. This time I made a static marketing site for the app, which is a bit less exciting but much more within my
                    skillset. I think it turned out well, you can judge for yourself <a href='https://watermyplants3.github.io/marketing-ui/' target='_blank'>here</a>
                    (I made the homepage and about page, as well as the header and footer present on every page).</p>
                    <p>Anyway, the first day back was interesting. I watched the videos in the training kit and felt a bit out of my depth initially,
                    with all this talk about Document Object Model and assigning elements to variables. After the lesson I felt I had a 
                    more solid grasp on the task at hand, so I took a swing at the project. I was fairly easily able to perform the task
                    I had been assigned, but I wasn't satisfied with my code.</p>
                    <p>Since the first day here at Lambda School, they've been telling us to make sure to write code that Doesn't Repeat Yourself,
                    or DRY for short. Even someone who has never touched coding could see that the code I had written repeated myself quite a bit.</p>
                    <img src='assets/code-bad.png' alt='Some pretty bad but passing code' title='No bueno' />
                    <p>Even though my code made the webpage display correctly, it wasn't good code. You can see where, towards the middle,
                    I began to write it in a slightly different way so that it was a bit less tedious but it was still the same pattern of 
                    writing a line to assign an element to a variable, then writing some code to put text in that element. I still had a stretch
                    project left to complete, but I knew there had to be a better way. I did some research and read a bunch of documentation and spent
                    around another hour tinkering with the project and ended up with what I think is a much better result:</p>
                    <img src='assets/code-good.png' alt='My best effort at code that is not repetitive' title="I even remembered to comment!" />
                    <p>To someone who can't read code it's much harder to suss out what this code does, but at the very least you can see
                    that there's not much repitition to be found, and without the comments it's about half as many lines. I wasn't going to get a better grade because I wrote my code better, but I 
                    finally felt at peace enough to move on to the stretch project of building a <a target = '_blank' href='http://jacobengland.computer/DOM-I/stretch-assignment/digital_timer/'>timer</a>.
                    All in all, I feel like I had a productive day, and I'm sure the drive to keep doing more than I'm asked to or will even
                    necessarily be rewarded for is going to benefit me as far as my learning experience goes.</p>

                <h2>An Event-full Day</h2>
                <time>02/11/2019</time>
                <section class='post-content'>
                    <p>Probably gonna be a short post today, it was kind of a slow and unproblematic day. Today was the second half of the beginning of lessons
                    really starting to get into what modern internet development is about. Yesterday was about dynamically inserting content and styling onto a 
                    page, and today was all about writing code to handle "events," such as a click, a scroll, or a key press. The styling language CSS has been 
                    updated since its beginnings to be able to handle some more basic events like clicking a button or detecting if the mouse is hover over an 
                    element on the page, but they aren't really useful for anything other than changing how something looks or where it is on the page</p>
                    <p>Most of the code used to handle these events follows the same basic structure. First we store an element on the page, like say the date 
                    at the top of this post. If you go inside of the code, it would be enclosed in a time tag, so we would tell Javascript to look for elements
                    inside of time tags and put them in a list. Then we would write code that would say to look at everything in that list and assign it what is 
                    called an "event listener," which is really just what it sounds like: a function that is waiting for an event to happen. You have to tell it
                    which event it is listening for, so in this case maybe a click. All that's left to do is to tell it what to do when it registers a click,
                    something like turning the text red. And that's it! The code we write might end up looking something like this:</p>
                    <img src='assets/event-listener.png' alt='Example code for an event listener function' title='No comments today! For shame!' />
                    <p>And you're done! It might still look a little complicated but it's really just those three steps: make a variable point at a page element, 
                    tack a function on to tell it which event to wait for, and tell it what to do when that event happens. If you can remember those three steps
                    you're well on your way to your first baby steps in making web pages that react to your user's input! If you're where I was earlier today though,
                    now you have to think of ten different things to make a webpage do, and that's a different beast entirely. . .</p>
