 <p>Nearly every webdev article seems to say that I should have some kind of blog charting 
    my journey through learning webdev, so I finally gave in. Of course as a webdev student 
    it wouldn't make any sense to blog on someone else's site, so I'm building my own. I don't 
    know enough about webdev yet to build anything other than a static site, so the beginning of
    this blog isn't going to look pretty. I am currently typing this blog post directly into the 
    HTML file, and I doubt the blog is going to look pretty at the end of tonight. Let's see for
    ourselves:</p>

    <p>Not my best work! But I figured it was better to get into the practice of blogging frequently
    over waiting to build a site to the standards I'd like to. It should also be interesting to see 
    the evolution of the blog site itself over time!</p>
    <p>A little background on me: I started webdev as a hobby early last year as a way to cope with 
    unemployment using <a target='_blank' href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/'>Free Code Camp</a> and various other 
    online resources. A combination of running into a wall learning-wise and re-employment caused me 
    to stray from the path shortly after I started learning React-Redux. It never really left my head,
    though, and in the fall of 2019 I applied to be in <a target='_blank' href='https://lambdaschool.com/'>Lambda School</a>
    and was accepted into the Web 28 cohort, starting in January.</p>
    <p>It's been a whirlwind of a time since then, spending at least 8 hours a day nearly every day either learning
    or coding. I've just now officially finished the first unit, which means I officially owe them money, so I suppose
    there's no dropping out at this point! In all seriousness, it's been a great learning experience so far and I'd 
    definitely give my recommendation to them. It's not for the faint of heart; the learning pace is breakneck and 
    the material covered is challenging. But the community is extremely supportive and if you ask for help and connect
    with your peers, I have no doubt you too could make it in this program. I need to stop ranting and start building this 
    blog site, so I'll leave it there for now. Here's hoping I make it past more than one post!</p>
